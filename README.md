# Game Design - "Asteroid"

* A feature-rich “Asteroid” game that supports multiplayer battle, environment simulation, physical inertia
movement, multi-mode setting, etc.

*  Implement the algorithms to achieve the simulation of physical inertial motion for spacecraft in
space, different degrees of fission for asteroids after hitting by the weapons, and rich sound and background effects
incorporated into different scenes to enhance the game experience, etc.
